toll on public health and economic activity as well as affecting our everyday lives.', ' In response to the pandemic, we implemented a strategic plan centered around five pillars of action: 1) ensuring safety of hotel employees and guests, 2) protecting shareholder value, 3) pre-serving working capital, 4) restructuring outstanding loans and 5) positioning the hotels to emerge successfully post-pandemic.', ' To meet our first priority of protecting the hotel employees and guests’ health and safety, we developed comprehensive plans with each of our third-party operators to implement safety protocols.', ' These protocols follow the latest guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health authorities, and take into account best “We believe environmental sustainability is key to deliv-ering durable, above-average value to our stakeholders.', '” practices across the industry.', ' Measures implemented include enhanced cleaning and disinfection (including that of our air ventilation systems), safe social distancing measures, case notification protocols, and training on Covid-19 safety measures for hotel employ-ees.', ' In addition, our hotels are increasingly offering various contactless services such as mobile check-in and check-out, and the option to have in-room dining and other guest amenities delivered to the door.', ' As one of the industries hit hardest by the fall in global travel demand, employment oppor-tunities in the hospitality sector were significantly affected.', ' In 2020, DiamondRock paid over $7 million in severance and health benefits to hotel employees regrettably displaced by the scant travel demand.', ' During these challenging times, we recognize the importance of promoting both physical and mental well being for our corporate and hotel employees and work with our third-party operators to offer virtual health benefits as well as training and development opportunities.', '

assistance for further education.', ' 3 DIAMONDROCK HOSPITALITY 2021 CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY REPORT As we address the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic, DiamondRock also recognizes the mounting global threat of climate change and is taking precautionary action against asso-ciated physical and transition risks.', ' From 2021 onwards, we will disclose climate-related risks and opportunities based on Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) recommendations.', ' During the valuation of new investment properties, we now perform a carbon pricing analysis to understand the expense of making new commercial property investments carbon neutral.', ' We believe environmental sustainability is key to delivering durable, above-average value to our stakeholders, and remain steadfast in the pursuit of our portfolio-wide 2025 environ-mental goals to reduce energy, carbon and water intensity by implementing programs designed to reduce our environmental impacts.', ' Our continued efforts in the environmen-tal, social and governance areas have earned us recognition as a Global Listed Sector Leader in Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark (“GRESB”) and as #1 among the

the CEO, our Chief Financial Officer (CFO), General Counsel and Vice President of Investments also have sustainability related objectives within their responsibilities and these objectives have predetermined consequences on their bonus compensation plans.', ' Our executive officers actively engage our Asset Management, Investment, Design, Development and Construction, Human Resources, Administration, as well as Legal, teams during weekly, monthly, and quarterly meetings to review operating performance at hotels and evaluate capital expenditures opportunities that contribute toward DiamondRock’s sustainability objectives.', ' DiamondRock has a portfolio-wide program of sustainable best practices.', ' Each year, DiamondRock’s Asset Management and Design and Construction teams formally collab-orate with the General Manager and Director of Engineering of each hotel in the portfolio to review all projects related to the property and propose these additional best practices.', ' Each project is proposed, evaluated, researched, and selected with a clear understanding and consideration of its sustainability impact.', ' We are committed to open and transpar-ent communications to engage our key stakeholders in identifying and implementing opportunities for enhancing sustainability performance.', ' DiamondRock engages with our tenants through multiple avenues, including a tenant (general manager) satisfaction survey, continuous communications, and sustainability training.', ' We also provide all of our general managers with environmental, social, and code of conduct policy documents.', ' Through tenant engagement, we aim to improve the per-formance of our portfolio and increase awareness as well as gather feedback around our sustainability program.', ' Within the properties, hotel employees are involved in monitoring sustainability progress and contributing feedback and ideas for further improvement.', ' Over 40% of our hotels have a sustainability champion and one-third have a sustainability team that meets at least every quarter.', ' Although DiamondRock is an owner and landlord, and does not operate our properties, we work each year, and collaborate with the individual operators to discuss their well-being and health plan for their employees, guests, and the community.', ' In October of each year, each hotel’s operator submits their plan around these areas to DiamondRock as part of the annual budget season, and the program for the year is discussed and determined.', ' Through our REIT collective engagement program, we also engage collectively with executives from hotel operators and brands on ESG topics.', ' For all new investments, our investment team works with energy consultants to address future risks and estimate future pricing before making capital allocation decisions.', ' An analysis is performed to understand the expense of making new investments carbon neutral.', ' For existing assets, our insurance consultant performs an annual risk assessment of water, hazard, fire and life safety, and natural disaster, and we take appropriate actions to mitigate any significant risks.', ' Prior to embarking on construction and renovation projects, DiamondRock’s in-house team and external consultants conduct a diligence process that addresses building safety, community impact, energy efficiency, air quality, waste and contamination.', ' We also opt for more sustainable building materials for our construction and renovation projects.', ' Our design and construction team also leverages municipal incentives to optimize the efficiency of our assets.', ' In 2020, DiamondRock was able to procure $65,000 in Maryland State energy credits to pay for the cleaning and high-speed efficiency enhancement of the Bethesda Marriott Suites’ guestroom heat pumps.', ' For dispositions, DiamondRock carefully considers the age, efficiency, energy, and carbon profiles of potential disposition candidates to assess
